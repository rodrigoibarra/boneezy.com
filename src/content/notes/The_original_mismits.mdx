Every single year I make the same dumb mistake, spend months thinking about what I’d like to dress up on halloween and not do it... But, I genuinely like the spoopy season. 

This year I didn’t even try to dress up, but there were parties to attend and fun to have. So we headed out to the spot, had a few beers and sang Misfits songs. 

The main idea behind this blog was to post more photos... I barely took any, it was dark, but here’s two.
