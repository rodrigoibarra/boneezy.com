description: Got hurt, now I’m rebuilding
---
A few months ago, I got very hurt during a competition, when it happened, it was both, confusing and scary, for a few seconds, I couldn’t feel my legs then everything tingled and I was very scared that I had seriously messed up my back. What followed was weeks of spasms on my leg and pain but through rest and recovery, I can now say I’ve been cleared.

I haven’t been back to training, it’s not a matter of pain or still being hurt, It’s mostly mental, the idea of walking back into the mat fills me with fear and doubt, so I need to take it one step at the time. So, for now we are at the gym, rebuilding muscle and confidence because I need to get back on the mat, that, today is still my happy place.
