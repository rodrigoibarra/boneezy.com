I'm starting this small blog as a place to just write some shit around instead of going to a thousand places like medium or roon to do it, most of whats published in here will be just random stuff, rants or web things but none work related so I can leave the blog at rodrigo-ibarra.com as a place to write about blog.

The site is hosted at GitHub, taking advantage of its Jekyll engine and instant deployment, I'll try to incorporate feuill.es to that framework but im still not sure how it will work since this is the first time ill be publishing anything in there. I'll probably write a follow up on the framework for this site.
