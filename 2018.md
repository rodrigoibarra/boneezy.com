<h1 class="banner">2018</h1>

Hey so it's a new year and I have a list of things I would like to accomplish, some are personal... some are work related, and some... well sometimes I just like to make shit up

Last year I did pretty great on my resolutions... It was mostly focused on building stuff, wether it was physical or digital, it didn't matter, building was the key. Now I'm trying to focus on getting better... Better at building stuff, better at work and most importantly better health-wise. Not that I'm sick or anything, I just want a healthier me.

## So here it is, the list:

- &#x25A2; Build something v2 Digital
- &#x25A2; Build something v2 Physical
- &#x25A2; Learn something new
- &#x25A2; Exercise at least 3 times a week
- &#x25A2; Quit smoking
- &#x25A2; Cut down on simple sugars
- &#x25A2; Drop to 78Kg

Those might not look too hard but believe me... they are. So lets recap... Building something digital is already on it's way, I'm working on a side project that will take care of it, also It's on a new language so I'm learning something new. Building something physical will be a bit trickier but I want to put together a full cosplay level thing for halloween, it might be Star Wars inspired (*I want to build a new lightsaber*) or since Spider-verse is out this year, I would *love* to come up with my own *Spidey*...

The healthy ones... *sigh* Listen... I'll try. Now, with all this promises out of the way, lets look at them; Exercise at least 3 times a week, I need to figure out a way to track this. Quit smoking *No Prob... right?*. Simple sugars just go with eating healthier ant that will compliment exercising, so basically stay away from candy, and soda... Also I will cut down on my alcohol intake, it wasn't that high to begin with. Manage to do all those and the road to 78Kg is easier... I'm 88kg right now so 10kg should be doable and *maintainable*.

- &#x25A2; Also... blog moaaaar (*this I promise every year*)

So there you have it... New year, new goals... or similar goals... I don't know... but here's to 2018.
