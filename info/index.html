    <div class="postExcerpt">
        <p>Born and raised in México City, I spend my time online or making dumb stuff, or thinking about making dumb stuff... I usually drive around the city but if the weather is nice I like to skate around on my longboard and cruise around my beautiful city.</p>

        <p>I work @ <a href="http://prepaenlinea.sep.gob.mx">Prepa en Línea</a> where I'm mostly in charge of DevOops. On any free time I do some web design consulting here and there, here's <a href="https://rodrigo-ibarra.com">here's my pro site</a> for more info.</p>

        <p>I love to shoot photos of random stuff going on around me or of the food im eating, you can find all of them <a href="/photos">here.</a> </p>
