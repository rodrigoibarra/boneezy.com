    <p><em>Disclaimer: While this is being written really way into the night, by no means does this mean it was written while being drunk, this is me, 100% sober and honest.</em></p>

    <p>It’s being almost 24 hours&#8230; I’m not really counting but when you can’t sleep, or think about something other than what’s on your mind, you get really good at tracking time, not much as tracking it but reliving it. </p>

    <p>On those 24 hours I’ve spent a good deal on thinking of something to say&#8230; </p>

    <p>Not to fix something that I’ve broken (and boy did I broke that last nice thing I had&#8230; I tend to do that)</p>

    <p>Not to go back on something that was said.</p>

    <p>Or to make something that hasn’t happen, happen.</p>

    <p>Not even to try to convince you of changing your mind.</p>

    <p>No.</p>

    <p>Actually, I’ve been looking for the right words to disagree with you&#8230; Let me explain&#8230; There seems to be some slight misunderstanding about this whole concept of liking you, while I wholeheartedly agree that I don’t know you, It should be noted that there’s supposed to be a “enough” after that statement. And I have no problem not knowing you completely because&#8230; Quite frankly, who does? </p>

    <p>So yeah&#8230; I don’t know you, but I know enough.</p>

    <p>I know you are not perfect&#8230; </p>

    <p>I know you have issues&#8230;</p>

    <p>Yeah&#8230; you like to drink&#8230;</p>

    <p>You like to read&#8230;</p>

    <p>You are incredibly talented, yes&#8230; yes you are, much more talented than me, that’s how I know.</p>

    <p>You are smart&#8230; and funny and a little bit on the weird side</p>

    <p>You are interesting.</p>

    <p>You know what else I know? I know you are not a bad person&#8230; A bad person would’ve taken advantage of the dumb kid who likes her. You may be crazy&#8230; You may be broken&#8230; You may have some issues but nothing I’ve seen in 6 years speaks to that so called awfulness&#8230; An if there is, then clearly you are great at hiding it in which case, wow&#8230; hat’s of to you then.</p>

    <p>So I would like to disagree&#8230; Yes, you are not perfect but perfect is boring&#8230; </p>

    <p>And those are the words I’ve come up with&#8230; Letters that carry a message, written in a language not our own but became ours, that we spoke from the beginning to here&#8230; These sentences that if they should ever mean anything they should mean this: </p>

    <blockquote>
    <p><strong>“Do not sell yourself short, do not think less of yourself&#8230; and by no means should you ever consider yourself that bad of a person or that full of shit, clearly you are filled with awesome stuff also. Enough to make me notice them and after all this time, I can honestly say and while sober nontheless, you are amazing.”</strong></p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>So this is it, stay awesome, stay beautiful, enjoy the little things, remember the good and focus on staying on that path. If you need anything I’ll still be there and since it’s too late to go back now, I guess I’ll see you here, at the end of the road.</p>
    <p class="b">B.</p>
    <p><em><small>P.S.Where are we going from here? What's gonna happen? No idea I just had to get this of my chest and say something.</small></em></p>
