        <p>Im hunched over my kitchen bar writting this, It's been a weird week, y'all don't know what happened last weekend, and quite frankly, I won't tell, but it led to one of those weeks. As it dawned to an end, I began this Sunday with depression settling in, dear reader, you will not believe how depressed this boi can get.</p>
<p>Whenever I'm feeling down, or whenever I'm around sad people, the first thing I think of is food, feeding myself and others is my love language, so I went out searching for comfort food, got on my car, played Friends for Life by X Ambassadors on repeat and set out to find, peace of mind and emotional estability on a plate of bulgogi and coppeus amounts of Kimchi. When in doubt, add kimchi. I did not get that far... a few minutes away from my favorite Korean spot, I ran into that one place that had been eluding me, I've been meaning to eat here for literal months, but life is not kind, or maybe fate, in it's omniscient glory saved that experience for a rainy day, my best bet is the latter.</p>
<p>So I went around the corner 5 times trying to find a parking spot, ended up parking a few blocks away, only to find a queue outside, no list, no hostess, shit, the door was closed, so I stood around for an hour like an idiot (to be fair, everyone chooses how to wait, me? like an idiot). Finally the door opened, I was next in line they ushered me inside, and closed the door, I had not seen a single person go out, but people were still somehow comning in. In a second, most of my questions were answered, there was no table for me to sit, BUT WAIT... &quot;there's a bar, you can have a few drinks and some food from our bar menu, while you wait, plz understand, we are packed and it's hard to sit a single person since we do not have too many small tables, do you still want to wait?&quot; yes... yes I did.</p>
<p>I was given a matchbox with the number 116, and was led to an area, sit wherever and someone will come and offer you a drink. This was maddness, there were like 20 different tables, and when I say different, well... one of them was a barrell, and another one was a few chairs around a stool with a lazy susan on top. As people left to be seated at their final tables, the rest of the bar shuffled around to ocupy a better spot, or grab a more comfortable chair, I myself changed tables thrice, one because I had sat at the end of a table where two people were having a date, I tried to make myself invisible, but they were kinda arguing, then someone else left, and I took the barrell, my final table was next to a couch, it was a coffee table, I felt right at home.</p>

<p>After a few beers I was buzzing, and hungry, I tried my best to keep myself ocupied, I snapped a bunch of pics for the gram, and was finally seated, dear reader I tell you, this food was insane, I ate my depression away, I started the meal with Mu Yang or grilled pork jowl, the dipping sauce was out of this world, then some sausagge with sticky rice, an assortment of micro greens, raw ginger and some cabbage, I did not paid enough attention and took a big bite of a thai chilli that sent me into a spice high. Then, a smash burger with some really good pickles and onions, their secret sauce and more beer. For dessert, chocolate chip cookies and milk infused with cinamon crunch, which is a fancy way of saying that they soaked tasty tasty cereal on milk and then discarded the cereal, leaving behind a sweet glass of cold milk worthy of the gods, it made me a little bit sad, and had me thinking of a girl whose a complete cookie monster.</p>

<p>By the end of then night, I was on cloud 9, this meal had hit the reset button, I wasnt exactly happy, but food is magic, I was in a way better place, my emotional bandwith had been recharged, all I needed was a cigarrete and happy tunes on my way back home. And here we are... a few hours later, I'm sipping on a Rose from a can, which seamed like a great idea back when I began writting this, only to ended up being a bit tipsy again 40 minutes later.</p>
<p>Never underestimate the power of food, Anthony Bourdain once said, &quot;<em>Food, may not be the answer to world peace, but it's a start</em>&quot; that man was wise and troubled, and I would like to think he would approve my cure for depression.</p>
<p>So there it is, food is magic and love, and it's hard not to be emotional about a great meal... dont judge me, I'm drunk.</p>
